# czmicrostl

Minimalistic STL library for microcontrollers.
This is by no means production quality.

I created this because I wanted to use modern C++ and STL with AVR microcontrollers.
Not under active development since the project this was being used on migrated to use the RP2040.

Feel free to use, but at your own risk.
